It was a professional video editing software developed by Apple. Final Cut Pro 7 was highly popular and widely used in the film and television industry for its advanced features and powerful tools. It allowed users to edit and manipulate video footage, audio, and graphics in real-time, making it a favourite among video editors who demanded high-speed and efficient workflows. In 2011, Final Cut Pro 7 was replaced with the highly controversial announcement of Final Cut Pro X; which is simply called Final Cut Pro now.","Marker Export was one necessary minor feature from Final Cut Pro 7. It allowed the user to export markers from your timeline as a separate file, which allowed the user to use for various purposes such as collaborating with other editors, sharing notes with clients or other team members, or simply keeping track of important points in your project. The user could add as many markers as needed in the timeline, and each marker can have a specific name, comment, and duration.","Once the user has added markers to his or her timeline, you could export them by going to File, Export, Markers List as Text. This will bring up the Marker Export window, where you can choose the format and location of the exported marker file. You could export markers in tab-delimited text with different export options.","Markers List as Text","When you export markers, Final Cut Pro 7 includes all the marker information, such as the name, comment, and duration, as well as the position in the timeline. This allowed the user and collaborators to reference specific points in the project and stay organised throughout the editing process productively.","Export Options","In Final Cut Pro, there is the widely used feature of Export XML(.fcpxml). Final Cut Pro is extremely powerful for handling Metadata. FCPXML contains most of the timeline’s information, include Marker Metadata. However, it is not easily accessible from the end user’s perspective. Hence, I would not associate Final Cut Pro's Export XML as a direct feature parity with legacy Final Cut Pro 7’s Marker Export.","Is it plausible for us to reinvigorate this functionality and modernise it to align with contemporary workflow requirements?"]}],[{"l":"Personal Shot library","p":["ShotDeck stands as a collaborative digital library of cinematic imagery created by the esteemed cinematographer, Lawrence Sher.

Users are granted the capability to execute nuanced searches using keywords, subsequently refining results through custom filters, ensuring a tailored and streamlined experience.","The primary limitation of the platform lies in its restriction on enabling users to download the metadata sets associated with their image decks in formats such as .json or .csv. Presently, users are only provided with export options in the form of .pdf files or .zip archives containing their image decks. It appears that the proprietors of ShotDeck aim to retain and lock users within their platform by deliberately omitting the provision for exporting metadata, thereby preventing users from seamlessly importing this data into alternative personal databases.","Imagine a scenario where users have the ability to effortlessly curate their own bespoke frame decks from a library of movie clips—a personalised library of cinematic moments. In a landscape where subscriptions to versatile platforms such as Notion or Airtable are prevalent, the question arises: why commit to additional enduring expenses when one can harness the expansive functionalities intrinsic to these platforms?
