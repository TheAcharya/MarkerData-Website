The Queue Window feature by **Marker Data** presents a sophisticated solution, empowering users to efficiently manage multiple Data Sets destined for various database and platform endpoints, including [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and/or [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/). This functionality enables consecutive queuing of Data Sets for seamless uploading, thereby streamlining the process of data dissemination. Notably, users have the flexibility to customise Database Profiles for each individual Data Set, tailoring the upload parameters to suit specific destination requirements. Such nuanced control fosters a refined approach to data management, allowing for optimal organisation and integration within diverse database ecosystems. This level of customisation underscores **Marker Data**â€™s commitment to facilitating precise and tailored data handling solutions, empowering users to leverage their data effectively across disparate platforms.

**Marker Data**'s Queue functionality accommodates 3 distinct scenarios.
