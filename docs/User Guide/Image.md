## File Creation

### Naming Mode

Naming Mode allows you to select your preferred `Marker IDs` and image `file-name` scheme. By [!badge text="Default"] **Marker Data** will use Markerâ€™s `Timecode` as its `Marker ID`. If the project name was `Demo V1`, **Marker Data** would generate the `Marker ID` as `Demo_V1_Timecode` and it will utilise the same `Marker ID` for the image `file-name` as well.

Depending on your workflow, you can also select `Name` or `Notes` as your `Marker ID`. These could be ideal for creating [VFX Database](/faq.md#what-is-the-appropriate-workflow-for-naming-vfx-ids). For both `Name` and `Notes`, it is ideal that you input unique text values. If your text values were found to be identical, **Marker Data** would automatically append a numerical suffix at the end of the filename.

## Image Size

### Width

By [!badge text="Default"] `Width` selection is disabled. **Marker Data** would automatically use the exact dimensions from your exported video file. When enabled, you can manually limit image width while keeping its aspect ratio.

### Height

By [!badge text="Default"] `Height` selection is disabled. **Marker Data** would automatically use the exact dimensions from your exported video file. When enabled, you can manually limit image height while keeping its aspect ratio.

### Size (%)

If your original exported video file had dimensions of `1920 x 1080`; when setting `Size (%)` value to `50`, the extracted images would be in `960 x 540`.
