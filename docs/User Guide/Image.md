## File Creation

### Naming Mode

In the Naming Mode feature, you have the ability to designate your preferred `Marker IDs` and establish a distinctive nomenclature for image file names. By [!badge text="Default"], the **Marker Data** function adopts the Marker's `Timecode` as its primary `Marker ID`. To illustrate, if the project were denoted as `Demo V1`, the `Marker ID` generated by 'Marker Data' would be `Demo_V1_Timecode`. This identifier is then employed for the corresponding image file name.

Alternatively, you can opt for `Name` or `Notes` as your preferred `Marker ID`, catering to diverse workflow requirements. Such choices are particularly advantageous for the creation of a Visual Effects (VFX) Database, as outlined in more detail [here](/faq.md/#what-constitutes-an-optimal-methodology-for-the-nomenclature-of-visual-effects-identification-vfx-ids-within-a-workflow). In the cases of `Name` and `Notes`, it is advisable to input unique text values to ensure distinctiveness. In instances where text values are identical, **Marker Data** autonomously appends a numerical suffix to the filename for differentiation.

![Selecting Naming Mode](/assets/md-image-settings_01.png)

Select your desired Naming Mode.
- **Timecode** [!badge text="Default"]
- **Name**
- **Notes**

### Marker Source

Select your desired Marker Source.
- **Marker** [!badge text="Default"]
- **Marker and Captions**
- **Caption**

### Image Format

By [!badge text="Default"], the **Marker Data** application undertakes the extraction and exportation of image data in the `PNG` format, preserving still frames. You have the flexibility to opt for either the `JPG` format or, alternatively, animated `GIFs` in the export process.

Select your desired Image Format.
- **PNG** [!badge text="Default"]
- **JPG**
- **GIF**

!!!info Info
The selection of the `GIF` format may result in a substantial increase in the file size of the exported images.

## Image Size

### Default

In the majority of workflows, the [!badge text="Default"] parameter would be sufficient. You have the ability to customise your image dimensions to a greater extent by opting for either the Size parameter or specifying the Width & Height values.

### Size (%)

The [!badge text="Default"] Configuration assigns a size percentage of `100` to both the `PNG` and `JPG` Image Formats. Conversely, for the `GIF` format, the [!badge text="Default"] size percentage is established at `50`. 

To illustrate, in the scenario where the original exported video file possesses dimensions of `1920 x 1080`, adjusting the Size (%) parameter to `50` would yield extracted images with dimensions reduced to `960 x 540`.

### Width

By [!badge text="Default"], the width selection feature is deactivated in **Marker Data**, with the application automatically adopting the precise dimensions from the exported video file. Activating this option allows you to manually constrain the image width while preserving its inherent aspect ratio.

### Height

By [!badge text="Default"], the height selection feature is deactivated in **Marker Data**, with the application automatically adopting the precise dimensions from the exported video file. Activating this option allows you to manually constrain the image height while preserving its inherent aspect ratio.

!!!info Info
We advise against setting the Size (%) value to exceed `60` when working with the `GIF` Image Format.

## JPG

### Quality

You have the flexibility to designate distinct `Quality` values for the `JPG` Image Format, with lower values resulting in reduced file sizes. Notably, the `Quality` setting is initially inaccessible, appearing greyed out by [!badge text="Default"], and exclusively applicable to the `JPG` format. The [!badge text="Default"] setting for Quality is established at `100`.

## GIF

### FPS

The Frames per Second (FPS) parameter is initially disabled by [!badge text="Default"], appearing greyed out. This functionality is exclusively applicable to the `GIF` Image Format, with a [!badge text="Default"] value set at `10`.

### Span (Sec)

The Size (%) parameter is initially disabled, displaying in a greyed out state by [!badge text="Default"]. This option is exclusive to the `GIF` Image Format, with the [!badge text="Default"] value pre-set at `2`.

![GIF with 15 FPS and 3 Sec Span](/assets/md-image-settings_05.gif)

!!!info Info
We advise against configuring the Frames per Second (FPS) value to exceed `15` and caution against setting the Size (%) value to surpass `3` when working with the `GIF` Image Format."
