## File Creation

### Naming Mode

Naming Mode allows you to select your preferred `Marker IDs` and image `Filenames` scheme. By [!badge text="Default"] **Marker Data** will use Markerâ€™s `Timecode` as its `Marker ID`. If the project name was `Demo V1`, **Marker Data** would generate the `Marker ID` as `Demo_V1_Timecode` and it will utilise the same `Marker ID` for the image `Filename` as well.

Depending on your workflow, you can also select `Name` or `Notes` as your `Marker ID`. These could be ideal for creating VFX Database. For both `Name` and `Notes`, it is ideal that you input unique text values. If your text values were found to be identical, **Marker Data** would automatically append a numerical suffix at the end of the filename.
