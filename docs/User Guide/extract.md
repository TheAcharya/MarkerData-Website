# Extract

![Extract Window](/assets/md-main.png)

**Marker Data** facilitates the execution of an extraction task through two distinct methodologies: an [automated approach via Share Destination](/user-guide/share-destination) and a manual alternative. Following the creation of your [Configuration](/user-guide/configurations), you have the option to either seamlessly drag and drop an `.fcpxmld` or `.fcpxml` file or by clicking the `Choose File` button.

!!!info Info
Export your timeline from Final cut Pro in `.mov` or `.mp4`.  Place it in the same location as your `.fcpxmld` or `.fcpxml` file. Make sure your `.fcpxmld` or `.fcpxml` and media file have identical filename.
