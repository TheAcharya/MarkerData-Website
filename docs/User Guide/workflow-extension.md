## Extract

**Marker Data** has its own Workflow Extension. Click the `Extensions` button on the left side of the **Final Cut Pro**’s toolbar.

!!!info Info
The Extensions button appears only when extensions are installed.
!!!

Initiate the extraction process by dragging your desired  `Project` from your **Final Cut Pro**’s `Browser` into the `Workflow Extension`, beneath the Extract Tab. Subsequently, **Marker Data** will promptly launch to commence the extraction process. **Marker Data** will automatically utilise [Active Configuration](/user-guide/configurations/#make-active-configuration) during the extraction process.

!!!info Info
When using the Extract Tab within the `Workflow Extension` of **Marker Data**, it is important to note that images will not be included in the extraction process. For a comprehensive extraction encompassing both images and Marker metadata, please utilise **Marker Data**’s [Share Destination](/user-guide/share-destination).

## Roles

Within the refined capabilities of **Marker Data**, users are empowered to make specific `Role` selection during the extraction process. By dragging and dropping the desired project from the  **Final Cut Pro**’s `Browser` into the Roles Tab within the `Workflow Extension`, **Marker Data** would retrieve metadata associated with the designated `Roles`. Subsequently you can `Enable` or `Disable` `Roles` based on their preferences. The extraction process can then be started through either **Marker Data**’s [Share Destination](/user-guide/share-destination) or the [Extract Tab](/user-guide/workflow-extension/#extract) within this Workflow Extension.
