!!!info Info
The Extensions button appears only when extensions are installed.
!!!

Initiate the extraction process by dragging and dropping any `Project` from your F**Final Cut Pro**’s `Browser` into the `Workflow Extension`, beneath the Extract Tab. Subsequently, **Marker Data** will promptly launch to commence the extraction process. **Marker Data** will automatically utilise [Active Configuration](/user-guide/configurations/#make-active-configuration) during the extraction process.
