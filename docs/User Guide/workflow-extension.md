## Extract

**Marker Data** has its own Workflow Extension. Click the `Extensions` button on the left side of the **Final Cut Pro**’s toolbar.

!!!info Info
The Extensions button appears only when extensions are installed.
!!!

Initiate the extraction process by dragging and dropping any `Project` from your F**Final Cut Pro**’s `Browser` into the `Workflow Extension`, beneath the Extract Tab. Subsequently, **Marker Data** will promptly launch to commence the extraction process. **Marker Data** will automatically utilise [Active Configuration](/user-guide/configurations/#make-active-configuration) during the extraction process.

!!!info Info
When using the Extract Tab within the `Workflow Extension` of **Marker Data**, it is important to note that images will not be included in the extraction process. For a comprehensive extraction encompassing both images and Marker metadata, please utilise **Marker Data**’s [Share Destination](/user-guide/share-destination).
