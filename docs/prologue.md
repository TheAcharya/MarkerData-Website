# Prologue

## Come on <a href="https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/TARS" target="_blank">TARS</a>!

![TARS translated quantum gravitational data into Morse code for Cooper to transmit from Gargantua's tesseract to Murph's watch on Earth. <br> Similarly, **Marker Data** streamlines the translation and transmission of Final Cut Pro's Marker metadata to databases.](assets/interstellar_01.gif)

As I developed [Shot Data](https://commandpost.io/toolbox/shot-data/) workflow, I soon realise that there could be a similar technique to parse Marker metadata from Final Cut Pro to Notion or any database in a meaningful and dynamic way. 

- What if users could manage and organise Final Cut Pro Markers, VFX Shots, Comments and Edit Notes effectively and smartly?
- What if users could collaborate and share database with other team members without worrying about exorbitant platform cost?
- Could all of the steps be achieved with a click of a button or key-stroke?

With the above mentioned thoughts, I intent to address the following objectives to improve and enhance the user’s experience.

## Application Objectives

- It should provide the user with a near “**single**” click experience. Excluding initial setup.
- It should provide native Airtable or Notion uploading in a consecutive fashion.
- It should provide the options for extracting for both PNGs and animated GIFs. Why GIFs!? It is because both Notion and Airtable supports GIFs. And animated GIFs provides a better frame identification than a static still images.
- It should have native Burn-In options for labels.
- It should not require any additional application other than the application itself.
- The exported Data Set should be portable and self-contained.
- It should support clips with Colour Grades, Effects and Titles applied.
- It should support Camera RAW files like [REDCODE RAW](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/final-cut-pro/ver715436b78/mac), [Canon Cinema RAW](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/final-cut-pro/ver10fade120/mac) and [Blackmagic RAW](https://brawtoolbox.io/).
- It should make and introduce database workflows more accessible to users.
- It should save user’s time.

Enter **Marker Data**!
