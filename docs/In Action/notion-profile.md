## Updating Specific Column Data

In the event that you seek to update and merge select column data, you may employ the 'Merge only' option. In this example, our focus is solely on updating the `Notes` column. Nevertheless, it is imperative to also enable the `Icon Image` option to ensure the page icons of individual Notion entries remain intact. Otherwise, page icon will be empty.
