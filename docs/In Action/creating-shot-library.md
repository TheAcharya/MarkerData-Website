## Final Cut Pro to Notion

## Afterthoughts

This bespoke creation of the Shot Library Database is distinctively tailored to each user, with no additional subscription required beyond that of Notion itself. However, it does necessitate manual input and extensive data collection for each frame.

Commercial solutions generally alleviate the burden of organisation, tagging, cataloging, and curation, yet this convenience is reflected in the cost passed onto the user. These platforms allow users to dedicate their time primarily to searching and selecting the precise shots needed for their projects.

Moreover, many of these platforms bind users within their ecosystem, lacking any functionality for data exportation. They do not provide APIs that would permit the integration of image sets into a userâ€™s own database, thus limiting flexibility and control over personal data.
