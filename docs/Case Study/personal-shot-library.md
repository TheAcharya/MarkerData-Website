[ShotDeck](https://shotdeck.com) stands as a collaborative digital library of cinematic imagery created by the esteemed cinematographer, [Lawrence Sher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003394/). This library boasts a comprehensive search functionality, facilitated by the meticulous tagging of each image with over 50 discerning keywords. Its organisational prowess extends to categorisations that encompass diverse facets such as movie genre, lighting nuances, frame dimensions, scene types, and more. Noteworthy is the feature allowing the creation and sharing of image decks among members.

Functioning as an invaluable time-saving resource, ShotDeck emerges as an indispensable collaborative tool tailored for professionals navigating the intricate realms of film, media, and advertising. Its purpose lies in simplifying the process of crafting image decks at various project stages—be it the pitch, preparation, or actual production. A noteworthy distinction is the claim to fame as the most extensive library of high-definition, easily searchable movie images globally.

The platform’s organisational schema extends beyond mere categorisations, encompassing movie genre, lighting intricacies, frame and lens dimensions, camera specifications, colour schemes, time-of-day considerations, and geographic locations. Users are granted the capability to execute nuanced searches using keywords, subsequently refining results through custom filters, ensuring a tailored and streamlined experience.

The primary limitation of the platform lies in its restriction on enabling users to download the metadata sets associated with their image decks in formats such as `.json` or `.csv`. Presently, users are only provided with export options in the form of `.pdf` files or `.zip` archives containing their image decks. It appears that the proprietors of ShotDeck aim to retain and lock users within their platform by deliberately omitting the provision for exporting metadata, thereby preventing users from seamlessly importing this data into alternative personal databases.

Imagine a scenario where users have the ability to effortlessly curate their own bespoke frame decks from a library of movie clips—a personalised library of cinematic moments. In a landscape where subscriptions to versatile platforms such as Notion or Airtable are prevalent, the question arises: why commit to additional enduring expenses when one can harness the expansive functionalities intrinsic to these platforms? Furthermore, the robust features inherent in any database transcend the capabilities of a specialised frame library like ShotDeck. Although ShotDeck boasts a vast collection of thousands of images, the distinct advantages of cultivating and maintaining a personalised shot database remain unparalleled.

**In light of these considerations, could we make this personalised shot library a reality?**
