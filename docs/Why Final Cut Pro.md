# Why Final Cut Pro?

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/2015_Final_Cut_Pro_Logo.png)

I strongly feel the users of Final Cut Pro have a unique mind than users of other NLE. No doubt the [Art of Editing](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Cut-Steve-Hullfish/dp/113823866X) remains the same. Because of the radical approach of the NLE Final Cut Pro users address their edits in a more visual and aural manner than the other NLEs.

> _“ Changing the tool will also affect the way that you approach the edit and when you change the way you approach the edit, you shake off old rust and cobwebs. You have to rethink your own approach to editing, not just the mechanical side, but also the psychological approach. ”_<br />

With **Marker Data**, I strongly believe Final Cut Pro users can relinquish monotonous tasks and significantly focus on their creative editorial.
