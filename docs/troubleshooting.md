# Troubleshooting

## Why is the upload speed to Notion slow?

The slow upload speed to Notion could be attributed to potential issues with Notion's servers or regional server connectivity. Please verify the current [status](https://status.notion.so/) of Notion's servers

## Why are there no images in the extract folder?

Please ensure that you are using **Marker Data**'s [Share Destination](/user-guide/share-destination). Images will not be extracted when using **Marker Data**'s [Workflow Extension](/user-guide/workflow-extension).
