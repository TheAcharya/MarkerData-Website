# Application Objectives

## Come on <a href="https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/TARS" target="_blank">TARS</a>!

![TARS helped Cooper to translate quantum gravitational data to Morse code so that Cooper could transmit the data to Murph’s watch from tesseract within Gargantua back to Earth. Similarly, **Marker Data** will help us translate and transmit Final Cut Pro’s Marker metadata to databases effortlessly.](assets/interstellar.gif)

As I developed [Shot Data](https://commandpost.io/toolbox/shot-data/){target=“_blank”} workflow, I soon realise that there could be a similar technique to parse Marker metadata from Final Cut Pro to Notion or any database in a meaningful and dynamic way. 

- What if users could manage and organise Final Cut Pro Markers, VFX Shots, Comments and Edit Notes effectively and smartly?
- What if users could collaborate and share database with other team members without worrying about exorbitant platform cost?
- Could all of the steps be achieved with a click of a button or key-stroke?

With the above mentioned thoughts, I intent to address the following objectives to improve and enhance the user’s experience.

## Ideal Workflow

- It should provide the user with a near “**single**” click experience. Excluding initial setup.
- It should provide native Airtable or Notion uploading in a consecutive fashion.
- It should provide the options for extracting for both PNGs and animated GIFs. Why GIFs!? It is because both Notion and Airtable supports GIFs. And animated GIFs provides a better frame identification than a static still images.
- It should have native Burn-In options for labels.
- It should not require any additional application other than the application itself.
- The exported Data Set should be portable and self-contained.
- It should support clips with Colour Grades, Effects and Titles applied.
- It should support Camera RAW files like [REDCODE RAW](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/final-cut-pro/ver715436b78/mac){target=“_blank”}, [Canon Cinema RAW](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/final-cut-pro/ver10fade120/mac){target=“_blank”} and [Blackmagic RAW](https://brawtoolbox.io/){target=“_blank”}.
- It should make and introduce database workflows more accessible to users.
- It should save user’s time.
